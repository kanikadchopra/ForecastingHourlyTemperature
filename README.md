# ForecastingHourlyTemperature
This was a group project to determine the best forecasting model to forecast hourly air temperatures one year in advance. My section of this project was to find the optimal smoothing and Box-Jenkins models and compare their forecasting capabilities. I also helped work on the preliminary analysis, i.e. ensuring stationary conditions were met.
